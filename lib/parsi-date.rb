# == Overview
#
# Date class represent a date in persian (jalali) calendar
#
# === Ways of calculating the date.
#
# In common usage, the date is reckoned in years since or before the Common Era
# (Hegira of Muhammad from Mecca to Medina in 622 CE), then as a month and
# day-of-the-month within the current year. This is known as the *Civil* *Date*,
# and abbreviated as +civil+ in the Date class.
#
# Instead of year, month-of-the-year, and day-of-the-month, the date can also
# be reckoned in terms of year and day-of-the-year. This is known as the *Ordinal*
# *Date*, and is abbreviated as +ordinal+ in the Date class. (Note that referring
# to this as the Julian date is incorrect.)
#
# For scientific purposes, it is convenient to refer to a date simply as a day
# count, counting from an arbitrary initial day. The date first chosen for this
# was January 1, 4713 BCE (-5335/9/1 in hijri solar calendar). A count of days from
# this date is the *Julian* *Day* *Number* or *Julian* *Date*, which is abbreviated
# as +jd+ in the Date class. This is in local time, and counts from midnight on the
# initial day. The stricter usage is in UTC, and counts from midday on the initial
# day. This is referred to in the Date class as the *Astronomical* *Julian* *Day*
# *Number*, and abbreviated as +ajd+. In the Date class, the Astronomical Julian
# Day Number includes fractional days.
#
# Another absolute day count is the *Modified* *Julian* *Day* *Number*, which
# takes November 17, 1858 (1237/08/26 in hijri solar calendar) as its initial day.
# This is abbreviated as +mjd+ in the Date class. There is also an *Astronomical*
# *Modified* *Julian* *Day* *Number*, which is in UTC and includes fractional days.
# This is abbreviated as +amjd+ in the Date class. Like the Modified Julian Day
# Number (and unlike the Astronomical Julian Day Number), it counts from midnight.
#
# === Time Zones
#
# DateTime objects support a simple representation of time zones. Time zones are
# represented as an offset from UTC, as a fraction of a day. This offset is the
# how much local time is later (or earlier) than UTC. UTC offset 0 is centred on
# England (also known as GMT). As you travel east, the offset increases until you
# reach the dateline in the middle of the Pacific Ocean; as you travel west, the
# offset decreases. This offset is abbreviated as +offset+ in the DateTime class.
#
# This simple representation of time zones does not take into account the common
# practice of Daylight Savings Time or Summer Time.
#
# Most DateTime methods return the date and the time in local time. The two
# exceptions are #ajd() and #amjd(), which return the date and time in UTC time,
# including fractional days.
#
# The Date class does not support time zone offsets, in that there is no way to
# create a Date object with a time zone. However, methods of the Date class when
# used by a DateTime instance will use the time zone offset of this instance.
#

require 'date'

module Parsi
  # Class representing a date.
  #
  # See the documentation to the file parsi-date.rb for an overview.
  #
  # Internally, the date is represented as an Astronomical Julian Day Number, +ajd+.
  # (There is also an +offset+ field for a time zone offset, but this is only for
  # the use of the DateTime subclass.)
  #
  # A new Date object is created using one of the object creation class methods
  # named after the corresponding date format, and the arguments appropriate to
  # that date format; for instance, Date::civil() (aliased to Date::new()) with
  # year, month, and day-of-month, or Date::ordinal() with year and day-of-year.
  #
  # Date objects are immutable once created.
  #
  # Once a Date has been created, date values can be retrieved for the different
  # date formats supported using instance methods. For instance, #mon() gives the
  # Civil month and #yday() gives the Ordinal day of the year. Date values can be
  # retrieved in any format, regardless of what format was used to create the
  # Date instance.
  #
  # The Date class includes the Comparable module, allowing
  # date objects to be compared and sorted, ranges of dates
  # to be created, and so forth.
